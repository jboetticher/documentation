# Getting Started

Install using your package manager of choice.

```bash
yarn add @zeitgeistpm/sdk @polkadot/api @polkadot/util
# or
npm i @zeitgeistpm/sdk @polkadot/api @polkadot/util
```

## Initialization

The zeitgeist sdk can be initialized in one of three different modes.

### Full(default)

The full mode has access to both the zeitgeist indexer and chain rpc apis, it
has a certain opinionative preference when querying for data and has access to
rpc transaction methods for submitting extrinsicÂ´s to the chain.

```ts
import type { FullContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, mainnet } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";

const sdk: Sdk<FullContext> = await create(mainnet());
```

:::info

This is the prefered mode for full applications that need to both query data in
a more optimized way and also need to interact with the chain itself.

:::

### Rpc Mode

The rpc mode connects only to the rpc chain node and has a bit more limitations
when querying for data.

```ts
import type { RpcContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, mainnetRpc } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";

const sdk: Sdk<RpcContext> = await create(mainnetRpc());
```

:::info

Prefer this mode when need to make sure you are only interacting with the latest
chain data for verification purposes or only need to submit transactions.

:::

### Indexer Mode

The indexer mode is only interacting with the indexed data and has no
transaction or chain query capabilities. It boots up quicker than the rpc or
full sdk.

```ts
import type { IndexerContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, mainnetIndexer } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";

const sdk: Sdk<IndexerContext> = await create(mainnetIndexer());
```

:::info

Prefer this mode when working with slightly stale(1-2 minutes) data is ok.
Perfect for static sites or analytics tools.

:::

## Battery Station

You can also connect to our test net using the sdk.

```ts
import type { FullContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, batterystation } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";

const sdk: Sdk<FullContext> = await create(batterystation());
```

## Local Dev Node

You can also connect to a localy running development node. Just note that if you
don't have the zeitgeist subsquid node also running locally you have to boot it
in rpc mode.

### Using local IPFS node

This works best if you are running a local node where you persist chain data to
disk and want to keep the stored metadata(markets) in a persisten synced state
with the chain data.

```ts
import type { RpcContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, createStorage } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { IPFS, LocalStorage } from "@zeitgeistpm/web3.storage";

const sdk: Sdk<RpcContext> = await create({
  provider: "wss://localhost:9944",
  storage: createStorage(
    IPFS.storage({
      node: { url: "localhost:5001" },
    })
  ),
});
```

### In the browser using localStorage

If you are working in the browser you can use localStorage as your metadata
persistence.

:::warning

Just keep in mind that the metadata created on markets is only available in your
local browser and has to be cleared when clearing the local chain node.

:::

```ts
import type { RpcContext, Sdk } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { create, createStorage } from "@zeitgeistpm/sdk";
import { LocalStorage } from "@zeitgeistpm/web3.storage";

const sdk: Sdk<RpcContext> = await create({
  provider: "wss://localhost:9944",
  storage: createStorage(LocalStorage.storage()),
});
```
