:::caution

This is the next evolution of the Zeitgeist SDK and might lack some features or
contain some bugs. But it is the preferred version to use if you want forward
compatibility.

Please report any issues you find on the
[Github repo issues page](https://github.com/zeitgeistpm/sdk-next/issues)

:::

The Zeitgeist SDK is a higher level developer experience that offers
functionality for the most common use cases for interacting directly with the
zeitgeist blockchain and the chaindata indexer.
